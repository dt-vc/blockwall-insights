      <p class="story-summary">
        The Senate Agriculture Committee has voted to advance a landmark crypto market structure bill that would establish the CFTC as the primary regulatory authority over cryptocurrencies. This bipartisan legislation represents a significant step toward providing regulatory clarity for the digital asset industry in the United States. The bill aims to create a comprehensive framework distinguishing between securities and commodities in the crypto space. For European founders and investors, this signals growing momentum toward clearer rules that could eventually harmonize with MiCA regulations.

        Escape Velocity has raised $62 million for its second fund focused on DePIN (Decentralized Physical Infrastructure Networks) projects, demonstrating investor conviction in the thesis despite an overall slowdown in crypto venture capital funding. The fund will support projects building real-world infrastructure using blockchain incentive mechanisms, from wireless networks to energy grids. DePIN represents one of crypto's most promising use cases for bridging digital assets with physical world applications. This raise suggests that experienced crypto investors are doubling down on infrastructure plays while broader market sentiment remains cautious.

      <div class="linkedin-content">Dear Founders, Investors, and Friends,

Exciting developments are shaping the crypto landscape this week. The Senate Agriculture Committee has advanced a key crypto market structure bill. This legislation establishes the CFTC as the primary regulatory authority over cryptocurrencies. Clearer rules like these pave the way for institutional adoption and innovation across Web3.

In DeFi news, Andre Cronje's Flying Tulip platform has raised an additional $75.5 million through token sales. The project now hits a $1 billion valuation with strong backing from investors like Amber Group, Paper Ventures, and Fasanara Capital. This includes a $25.5 million Series A round plus contributions via Impossible Finance. Flying Tulip offers a unified on-chain system with spot trading, perpetuals, lending, and the ftUSD stablecoin. All tokens come at $0.10 with a perpetual put option for principal redemption. Commitments already top $1.36 billion, signaling massive demand.

Real-world asset tokenization is also surging. Propy has secured $100 million in funding to build an AI-powered closing platform. This consolidates title and escrow services into a seamless end-to-end solution. Such advancements bridge traditional real estate with blockchain efficiency.

At Blockwall, we remain committed to backing Europe's top crypto builders amid this momentum. These stories highlight regulatory progress, DeFi maturity, and practical applications driving the next wave.

What trends are you watching in Web3 this week?
